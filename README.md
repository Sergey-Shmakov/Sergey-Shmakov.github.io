# Research scientist, NCBI/NLM/NIH

#### Summary: 
I am a research fellow with nine years of research and six years software developer experience. My research field is computational biology, where I develop and apply computational methods to analyze bacterial and viral genomes. I have discovered and characterized 14 novel CRISPR-Cas systems, participated in the classification of CRISPR-Cas systems, identified crRNA-like regulatory elements in model organisms and created a protocol to search for functionally associated genes. My research was published in high profile journals like Nature, Cell and Science.
